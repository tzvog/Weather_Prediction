How to work the API
===================

Ideally this was written within an IDE (pycharm) all that is
needed to be done make sure the app is within the following structure

-- api
    -- model
        -- filter_rule
    -- route
        -- weather_view
    -- schema
        -- config
    -- services
        -- error_handlers
        -- rule_function_aggregation_factory
        -- weather_access
-- venv
app

to run it either use your IDE and run the app.py page
or use the python app.py command in your terminal
